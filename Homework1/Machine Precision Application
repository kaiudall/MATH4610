## Application of Machine Precision in Linear Algebra

After perusing through the internet to find where machine precision is important, I stumbled upon an application in linear algebra. When using Gaussian Elimination, pivoting strategies are actually quite important in order to reduce error. After solving the issue of, "What if we have a pivot that is zero?" it is also important to take into account the relative size between pivots. An article titled [Pivoting Techniques in Gaussian Elimination](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemical-engineering/10-34-numerical-methods-applied-to-chemical-engineering-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lecturenotes123.pdf). The article details out a alteration to Gaussian Elimination called partial pivoting. For each pivoting step, we find the row with the largest value, and switch it to be the pivot.
