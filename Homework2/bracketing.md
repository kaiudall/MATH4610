##Sources for Bracketing Roots of Nonlinear, Single Real Variable Functions

In a [powerpoint](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.720.8609&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Berlin Chen, National Taiwan Normal University, methods for bracketing such as graphing out the function, and the incremental method are discussed. With only one variable, graphing a function seems like an obvious choice. Unlike using bisection, newton's method, secant method, functional point iteration, or any combination of the former, graphing allows us to look at much wider range of values and can help us identify better brackets for roots we want to find.

In a [paper](http://www.m-hikari.com/ams/ams-2018/ams-1-4-2018/p/intepAMS1-4-2018.pdf) by Somkid Intep, Burapha University, several alternatives to bisection are discussed, including the Regula Falsi Algorithm, Regula Falsi-Bisection-Parabolic Algorithm,  Bisection-Regula Falsi-Parabolic Algorithm, and others. If we were studying root bracketing further, these methods definitely seem more complex than simply using bisection.

In a [presentation](http://users.metu.edu.tr/csert/me310/me310_2_roots.pdf) prepared by Dr. CÃ¼neyt Sert, Middle East Technical University, talks about using the incremental search technique. This method definitely could help in identifying roots. The idea is to set up an interval of interest, divide the interval into n, equal subintervals, and check if the points on the boundaries of the subintervals change signs. You could then use this knowledge to apply any of the methods we have implemented.
