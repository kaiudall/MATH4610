# Kronecker Applications

The Kronecker product has [15 properties](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/henry/reports/kronthesisschaecke04.pdf), each of these properties are useful in different applications. Some properties I found to be interesting are: 

"Taking the transpose before carrying out the Kronecker product yields the same result as doing so afterwards."

"The Kronecker product is associative"

"The Kronecker product is left and right–distributive"

" The product of two Kronecker products yields another Kronecker product"

"The trace of the Kronecker product of two matrices is the product of the traces of the matrices"

"A ⊗ B is nonsingular if and only if both A and B are nonsingular"

A practical application for the kronecker product is that it can be used to solve systems of equations where a matrix is the unknown. Systems follow this general pattern ([page 11](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/henry/reports/kronthesisschaecke04.pdf)):

AX=B  
AX+BX=C (Sylvester equation)  
AXB=C  
AX+YB=C  

The Sylvester equation "plays a central role in control theory, Poisson equation solving, or invariant subspace computation..." ([page 12](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/henry/reports/kronthesisschaecke04.pdf))

In another paper, I found that the Kronecker product is useful for theoretical physics. "This is particularly useful in the description of multipartite quantum systems."
